Bug Reports
-----------

* Check if the bug already exists in the [issue tracker] before opening a
  [new issue].
* Include any relevant error messages and test cases, formatted as
  Markdown [code blocks]. Avoid linking to external paste services.
* Make test cases as minimal as possible.

Pull Requests
-------------

* Create a feature branch and submit a separate [pull request] for each
  issue. Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single request.
* Include as few commits as necessary, without any merge commits.
* Add test coverage for new code. Update tests for modified code. All new
  and existing tests should pass.

Commit Messages
---------------

* Hard wrap lines at 72 columns.
* Avoid GitHub-specific references (e.g. "fixes issue #9").

Coding Style
------------

* Above all else, be consistent with the existing code.
